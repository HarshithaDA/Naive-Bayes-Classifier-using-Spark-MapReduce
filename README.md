# Naive-Bayes-Classifier-using-Spark-MapReduce

I had used the AG News (AG’s News Corpus) dataset for developing a Naive Bayes Classifier using Spark MapReduce.

AG News (AG’s News Corpus) is a subdataset of AG's corpus of news articles constructed by assembling titles and description fields of articles from the 4 largest classes (“World”, “Sports”, “Business”, “Sci/Tech”) of AG’s Corpus. (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ag-news)

I have attached the .parquet files for training and testing sets in this repository.
